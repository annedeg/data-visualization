## The Cosmere - Book Length Viz

The [Cosmere](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere) is a epic fantasy
fictional universe designed by the author [Brandon
Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/).

The author has revelead that he plans to write more than [40
novels](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/5j8bkb/no_spoilersstate_of_the_sanderson_2016/dbgizmb/).
Currently only [23](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere) books are
published.

## Visualisation

In this visualization I want to represent reading time for each of the
books plus total number of words (which is the same thing) but grouped
for each independent Series.

Thereâ€™s also some standalone categories for the books that are not part
of any saga yet.

## Data

I gathered the data mainly from [here]() but also other sources.

All the data is available in this public
[gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vi3ZIA-aka0meB8rOLKByZWHnci1ow2kQ0eez35E_T4/edit?usp=sharing)
document.

## Usage

To use, just run inside R:

``` r
source("script.R")
```
